## Deploying a Python Web Application to Azure App Service

 This guide walks you through creating a resource group, setting up an Azure App Service with the Python stack, and deploying a simple Flask web application. We will cover all the steps, from creating the resource group to deploying the application via GitHub.

Step-by-Step Instructions
# 1. Create a Resource Group

    Log in to Azure Portal:
        Navigate to Azure Portal.

    Create a New Resource Group:
        Go to Resource groups.
        Click + Add.
        Enter a Name for your resource group.
        Select a Region.
        Click Review + Create and then Create.

# 2. Create an Azure App Service

    Navigate to App Services:
        In the Azure Portal, go to App Services.
        Click + Add.

    Configure App Service Settings:
        App name: Choose a unique name for your web app.
        Publish: Select Code.
        Runtime stack: Choose Python and select the appropriate version.
        Region: Select the same region as your resource group.
        Click Review + Create and then Create.

# 3. Deploy Your Code to Azure
Using GitHub

    Navigate to Deployment Center:
        In your App Serviceâ€™s settings, go to Deployment Center.

    Connect to GitHub:
        Select GitHub as your source.
        Click Authorize and sign in with your GitHub credentials.
        Choose the repository and branch you want to deploy from.

    Configure Deployment Settings:
        Set the Build Provider to GitHub Actions.
        Click Save to start the deployment process.

    Verify Deployment:
        Once deployment is complete, you will see a URL under the Overview tab of your App Service.
        Click the URL to access your web application.
        
# 4. Additional Configuration

    Environment Variables:
        Go to Configuration in your App Service settings.
        Add environment variables, such as FLASK_ENV=production.

    Scaling and Performance Settings:
        Navigate to Scale up (App Service plan) to adjust the pricing tier.
        Configure Auto-scaling rules if needed.

# 5. Testing and Accessing Your Application

    Access Your Application:
        Use the URL provided in the Overview tab to open your web application in a browser.

    Test Functionality:
        Verify that the application displays "Hello, Azure!" at the root URL.

# 6. Managing Your Web App

Azure App Service offers several features for managing and monitoring your application:

    Diagnostics and Monitoring:
        Enable Application Insights for performance monitoring and error tracking.
    Backup and Restore:
        Configure Backup under App Service settings to safeguard your application data.
    Configuration Settings:
        Modify settings such as environment variables, connection strings, and custom domains under Configuration.

## Conclusion
