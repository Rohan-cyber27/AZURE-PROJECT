# Implementing Azure Site Recovery for Disaster Recovery

## Project Overview
This project focuses on setting up Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to ensure business continuity by replicating on-premises workloads and Azure VMs to a secondary Azure region. In case of a disaster, you can failover to the replicated resources and continue operations with minimal downtime.

## Azure Services Used
- Azure Site Recovery (ASR)
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure Storage
- Azure Networking
- Azure Automation (optional)

## Steps

### 1. Set Up Azure Site Recovery

#### Navigate to Azure Site Recovery
- In the Azure portal, search for "Site Recovery" and select it from the search results.
- Click on "+ Create and configure a vault."

#### Create a Recovery Services Vault
- **Subscription:** Select your Azure subscription.
- **Resource Group:** Create a new resource group or select an existing one.
- **Vault Name:** Enter a name for the vault.
- **Region:** Select the region where you want the vault to be created.
- Click "Review + create" and then "Create."

### 2. Prepare Source Environment

#### Install the Site Recovery Provider
- Download and install the ASR Provider on your on-premises Hyper-V host or VMware vCenter server.
- Register the provider with the Recovery Services vault.

#### Configure the Source Environment
- For on-premises VMs, configure the necessary permissions and networking settings to allow communication with Azure.
- For Azure VMs, ensure the VMs are in the same or different regions that support ASR.

### 3. Create a Replication Policy

#### Navigate to the Recovery Services Vault
- In the vault, go to "Site Recovery Infrastructure" > "Replication policies."
- Click on "+ Add" to create a new replication policy.

#### Configure Replication Policy
- **Name:** Enter a name for the policy.
- **Recovery Point Retention:** Set the number of recovery points to retain.
- **Application Consistent Snapshot Frequency:** Set the frequency of application-consistent snapshots.
- Click "OK" to create the policy.

### 4. Enable Replication

#### Set Up Target Environment
- Configure the target settings in Azure, such as the target region, storage account, and network.
- Ensure that the target region supports the desired configurations for the replicated VMs.

#### Configure Replication for VMs
- In the Recovery Services vault, go to "Replicated items" and click "+ Replicate."
- Select the source and target settings for the VMs you want to replicate.
- Choose the replication policy created earlier.
- Click "Enable replication" to start the replication process.

### 5. Test the Replication

#### Run a Test Failover
- In the Recovery Services vault, go to "Replicated items."
- Select a replicated item and click on "Test Failover."
- Choose the recovery point and the target network for the test failover.
- Verify that the VM boots up correctly and that applications function as expected.
- Perform necessary tests and then clean up the test failover environment.

### 6. Configure Failover and Failback

#### Plan for Failover
- Document the failover procedure, including the sequence of steps and any manual interventions required.
- Train staff on the failover process to ensure smooth execution during an actual disaster.

#### Perform a Planned Failover
- In the Recovery Services vault, select the replicated item and click "Failover."
- Choose a recovery point and initiate the failover.
- Verify that the failover is successful and that applications are running correctly in the target environment.

#### Configure Failback
- Once the primary site is back online, configure the failback process to return workloads to the primary site.
- Use Azure Site Recovery to replicate changes made during the failover back to the primary site.

# By implementing Azure Site Recovery, enhance your organization's resilience to disasters, ensuring that critical applications and data remain available even in adverse conditions.
